# Rafpot Labs
This project will become a base for most of my projects. I've been inspired by this [vanilla css article](https://www.zolkos.com/2025/12/03/vanilla-css-is-all-you-need), written by Rob Zolkos. I have a deep love for (attempting) building beautiful systems, and I've been quite unhappy with my path of late. Tailwind this, Shadcn that. Incredible tools that saved me a ton of hours, but I also just enjoy doing everything and learning the tiny details.

So this project is all about getting back into these details - slowly.

## Core Idea
I still plan to use SvelteKit. But i will opt for vanilla CSS (first time in a long time).
I will also opt for [bits-ui](https://www.bits-ui.com/) and style everything from scratch. 
Since SvelteKit scopes styling, it won't really be difficult. 

I also want to create a color system that I can use across all of my projects (of which there will be many).


## Stack
- *[SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/)*: Metaframework of choice
- *[Bits UI](https://www.bits-ui.com/)* or *[Melt UI](https://next.melt-ui.com/)* for accessible primitives
- *[Runed](https://runed.dev/docs)*: Helper library for all things Svelte
- *[PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io/)*: for most database needs
- *[Convex](https://www.convex.dev/)*: for heavy database needs
- *[Zod](https://zod.dev/)*: Schema validation

## Tasks
