# CSS System

## Original Goal
Initially I read [vanilla css
article](https://www.zolkos.com/2025/12/03/vanilla-css-is-all-you-need) and I
was intrigued. I haven't really used anything but Tailwind since early 2022 so i sort of missed a wave of new features. I also have a few issues with Tailwind.


## Tailwind issue 1: Readability
I find it harder to read Tailwind when i go back into a project. Something about css classes being scattered horizontally throws my brain off. And yes, I do know what each class means. I just read faster when scanning vertically.

## Tailwind issue 2: CSS in JS
A lot of the time I will have to inject tailwind into Javascript. You might have seen variables like
`const baseStyles = "tailwind-classes-go-here"`. There's a good reason for this, it's hard to apply the correct tailwind classes without using some javascript when having any component with variants. You either need to add some classes based on a variant, or ignore them. The following is from the button component from [shadcn-svelte](https://www.shadcn-svelte.com/):

```typescript
	import { cn, type WithElementRef } from "$lib/utils.js";
	import type { HTMLAnchorAttributes, HTMLButtonAttributes } from "svelte/elements";
	import { type VariantProps, tv } from "tailwind-variants";

	export const buttonVariants = tv({
		base: "focus-visible:border-ring focus-visible:ring-ring/50 aria-invalid:ring-destructive/20 dark:aria-invalid:ring-destructive/40 aria-invalid:border-destructive inline-flex shrink-0 items-center justify-center gap-2 rounded-md text-sm font-medium whitespace-nowrap transition-all outline-none focus-visible:ring-[3px] disabled:pointer-events-none disabled:opacity-50 aria-disabled:pointer-events-none aria-disabled:opacity-50 [&_svg]:pointer-events-none [&_svg]:shrink-0 [&_svg:not([class*='size-'])]:size-4",
		variants: {
			variant: {
				default: "bg-primary text-primary-foreground hover:bg-primary/90 shadow-xs",
				destructive:
					"bg-destructive hover:bg-destructive/90 focus-visible:ring-destructive/20 dark:focus-visible:ring-destructive/40 dark:bg-destructive/60 text-white shadow-xs",
				outline:
					"bg-background hover:bg-accent hover:text-accent-foreground dark:bg-input/30 dark:border-input dark:hover:bg-input/50 border shadow-xs",
				secondary: "bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground hover:bg-secondary/80 shadow-xs",
				ghost: "hover:bg-accent hover:text-accent-foreground dark:hover:bg-accent/50",
				link: "text-primary underline-offset-4 hover:underline",
			},
			size: {
				default: "h-9 px-4 py-2 has-[>svg]:px-3",
				sm: "h-8 gap-1.5 rounded-md px-3 has-[>svg]:px-2.5",
				lg: "h-10 rounded-md px-6 has-[>svg]:px-4",
				icon: "size-9",
				"icon-sm": "size-8",
				"icon-lg": "size-10",
			},
		},
		defaultVariants: {
			variant: "default",
			size: "default",
		},
	});

	export type ButtonVariant = VariantProps<typeof buttonVariants>["variant"];
	export type ButtonSize = VariantProps<typeof buttonVariants>["size"];

	export type ButtonProps = WithElementRef<HTMLButtonAttributes> &
		WithElementRef<HTMLAnchorAttributes> & {
			variant?: ButtonVariant;
			size?: ButtonSize;
		};
```
